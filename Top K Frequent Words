Given an array of strings words and an integer k, return the k most frequent strings.
Return the answer sorted by the frequency from highest to lowest. Sort the words with the same frequency by their lexicographical order.

Solution
class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, words: List[str], k: int) -> List[str]:
        iterWords= {}
        words.sort()
        for word in words:
            if word in iterWords.keys():
                iterWords[word] += 1
            else:
                iterWords[word] = 1
        ans = sorted(iterWords, key = lambda x: (-iterWords[x], x))
        return ans[:k]
